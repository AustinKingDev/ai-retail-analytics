## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher installed
- Maven 3.8+ installed
- An OpenAI API key (you must provide your own)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/ai-retail-agent.git
   cd ai-retail-agent

2. **Configure application properties:**

    By default, the application uses an H2 in-memory database with seeded sample dataâ€”no SQL database setup is required for local development.

- The H2 database runs in-memory and is available only while the application is running.
- You can access the H2 web console at [http://localhost:8080/h2-console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console).

   Set your OpenAI API key in `src/main/resources/application.properties`: openai.api.key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

> **Note:** You must provide your own valid OpenAI API key.

3. **Build the project:**

   ```sh
   mvn clean install

4. **Run the application:**

    ```sh
    mvn spring-boot:run
The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.
